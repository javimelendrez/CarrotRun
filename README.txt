Intro: To create this game we used p5.js and javascript to draw the game. The game is a 2D endless runner. The objective of the game is avoiding colliding with the npc
bunnies by jumping over them and surving as long as you can. You can keep track of your score by collecting the coins placed above the NPC bunnies. On the top right you can view youe
score and aim for a better run in your next game. All the objects in the game were programmed using classes. Within their constructors
they are provided with the essential sizing and location of the object on the canvas. Each object
then has their own respect functions which can be called for which provide the functionality to
move and draw the object.
